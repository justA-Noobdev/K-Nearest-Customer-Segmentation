# K-Nearest-Customer-Segmentation
Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.

Telecommunications Customer Segmentation and Predictive Modeling
================================================================

This repository contains the code and resources for my data analysis project on customer segmentation and predictive modeling in the telecommunications industry.

Project Overview
----------------

The goal of this project is to develop a classifier that can predict the service usage patterns of customers based on demographic data. By categorizing customers into four distinct groups, we aim to enable telecommunications providers to customize their offers and enhance customer experiences.

Dataset
-------

The dataset provided by the telecommunications provider includes various demographic features such as region, age, and marital status, along with the target field called "custcat." The "custcat" field has four possible values: Basic Service, E-Service, Plus Service, and Total Service. These values represent the different customer groups we seek to classify.

Methodology
-----------

To tackle the classification problem, we employed the K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a popular machine learning algorithm that predicts the class of a new or unknown case based on the similarity to its nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Getting Started
---------------

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone [https://github.com/your-username/telecom-customer-segmentation.git](https://github.com/justA-Noobdev/K-Nearest-Customer-Segmentation.git)`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd K-Nearest-Customer-Segmentation`
3.  Install the required dependencies: `pip install matplotlib pandas numpy scikit-learn`
4.  Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the data analysis and modeling process.
